# Saathi AI: Your AI-Powered E-commerce Assistant

## 📝 Project Description

Saathi AI is a comprehensive, AI-powered application designed to streamline and enhance the e-commerce experience for sellers. The primary goal of this project is to provide sellers with a suite of intelligent tools that simplify complex tasks like inventory management, product listing, and market analysis. By leveraging the power of generative AI, Saathi AI empowers sellers to make data-driven decisions, optimize their online stores, and stay competitive in a fast-paced market.

### Technology Choices

- **React with Vite:** We chose **React** for its component-based architecture, which allows for the creation of reusable UI elements and a more organized codebase. **Vite** was selected as the build tool for its incredibly fast development server and optimized build process, resulting in a smoother and more efficient development experience.

- **FastAPI:** For the backend, we opted for **FastAPI**, a modern Python web framework. Its high-performance nature, automatic interactive documentation, and simple syntax make it an excellent choice for building robust and scalable APIs.

- **Groq & Google Generative AI:** The core of our AI-powered features is driven by **Groq** and **Google Generative AI**. Groq's fast inference engine ensures that our AI chat provides real-time responses, while Google's advanced models enable sophisticated features like demand forecasting and AI-driven product recommendations.

- **Firebase Authentication:** To ensure secure and reliable user management, we integrated **Firebase Authentication**, which provides a robust and easy-to-implement solution for handling user sign-up, login, and session management.

- **Appwrite:** We use **Appwrite** as a powerful backend-as-a-service for managing our database (products, orders) and storage, providing a secure and scalable foundation for our data.

By combining these technologies, we've created a powerful and responsive application that delivers a seamless user experience while handling complex data processing and AI-driven tasks on the backend.
